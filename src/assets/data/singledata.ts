In a film, the black areas represent the places where the photons passed through soft tissues. The white areas represent the denser tissues, i.e. the bones which can absorb the photons.

        detail:"In a syringe pump, fluid is held in the reservoir of a syringe, and a moveable piston controls fluid delivery. In an elastomeric pump, fluid is held in a stretchable balloon reservoir, and pressure from the elastic walls of the balloon drives fluid delivery. The infusion is administered by injecting a needle attached to a small tube directly into one of the patient's veins. This tube is connected to an IV bag containing the prescribed medication. Once attached to your vein, the solution slowly drips into your bloodstream."

        detail:"A built-in computer checks a victim's heart rhythm through adhesive electrodes. The computer calculates whether defibrillation is needed. If it is, a recorded voice prompts the rescuer to press the shock button on the AED. This shock momentarily stuns the heart and stops all activity. The act of defibrillation delivers an electrical shock across the chest, either by placing a pair of manual paddles on the chest or through the application of adhesive “hands-free” pads. Current defibrillators typically utilize a biphasic waveform that needs a lower energy level to achieve effective defibrillation."
